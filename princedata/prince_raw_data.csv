They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all

I am yours now and you are mine

All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die

In her hand she holds the very key
Words of compassion, words of peace
And in the distance an army's marching feet
  (1 2 3 4 - 1 2 3 4)
But behold, we will watch them fall
And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love only blasphemy
And in the distance, 6 others will curse me
But that's alright
(That's alright)

No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die
(Just how old)
And we will see a plague and a river of blood
And every evil soul will surely die in spite of
Their 7 tears, but do not fear
4 in the distance, 12 souls from now
You and me will still be here, we will still be here
There will be a new city with streets of gold
The young so educated they never grow old
And a there will be no death for with every breath
The voice of many colors sings a song
That's so bold
Sing it while we watch them fall
All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savior-faire
No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine

A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books 4 the fight she would be in
One day over this hoodie
She got beat for some clothes and her rep
With her chin up, she scolded all y'alls molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step
And step she did to the straight as
Then college, the master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work for free?
Know, why?
So what if my sisters are triflin'?
They just don't know
She said mama didn't tell 'em what she told me

But it feels like a million days
If eye had a magic wand eye could turn back time
Eye'd never let you go away
Eye didn't have the heart to say eye'm sorry
Now eye haven't got a heart at all
Eye could tolerate the pain if eye could talk to my best friend
But you won't even call, won't even call
Eye'm contemplating pulling out my suitcase
And packin' everything eye own
Eye didn't back then but eye do know now
Wherever you are is home
Eye'll crawl on my belly and beg you
But your so far away
You've only been gone for an hour
But it seems like a million days

But your the perfect picture of what love should look like
And eye wanna be your frame

How could I illustrate how much I really care?

A Place In Heaven
She wants a place in heaven 
But she cannot face the truth 
She lives on a rope of self-pity 
It only requires a noose 
Why are the ones so afraid 2 live 
Much more afraid 2 die? 
It's as easy 2 imagine laughing 
When U really hear a cry 
And they sound the same 
In hell, they sound the same 
U want a place in heaven 
Maybe U're already there 
Life's what U make it, stop whining baby 
Love comes 2 those who care 
There must be children in heaven 
Ones who know nothing from hate 
3-year-old leaders of all colors 
I'd feel safer with them in control, control, control, control 
3-year-olds in control 
We all want a place in heaven 
Suites of that level are few 
Let's not be lazy, there's no room service 
It's all up 2 me and U

If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define just what you mean to me
From the first moment I saw you, I knew you were the one
That night I had to call you, I was rappin' till the sun came up
Tellin' you just how fine you look in a word, you were sexy
All of my cool attitude you took my body was next
You made love to me, like you was afraid
Was you afraid of me? Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy? That's why

I know, you know that I ain't cheatin' baby
They know this is serious, this ain't just for kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial, crucial
You could say that, I'm a terminal case
You could burn up my clothes, smash up my ride
Well maybe not the ride, but I got to have your face, all up in the place
I'd like to think that, I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace
But nothin' baby, I said nothin' can compare
To your lovely face, do you know what I'm sayin' to you?
I'm just tryin' to say

Can I talk to you? Tell you what you mean to me
Every time you wander, I'll be your eyes so you can see
I wanna show you things that I never showed no other, I wanna be
More than your  , more than your brother
I wanna be like no other, if you need me, I'll never leave
I know, that you know, without you there is no me
There is no me, without you there is no sea there is no shore

When I did you right, you did me wrong
Ain’t gonna miss you when you’re gone
Only thing I’m leaving you: alone
By my critique, something’s changed
Every time you speak, it sounds deranged
Blessed are the meek
You used to be my girl
Now you’re just a freak
That’s going back in the world
Ain’t gonna miss you when you’re gone
Only thing I’m leaving you: alone

Sitting, counting the years

I only pray that when you dream, I'm the one you dream of
I pray that when you dream, you dream of how we kiss
Not with our lips but with our souls, stop me if I bore you
Why is it that I think we'd be so good in bed?
Can you hear me? Why do I love you so much?
It's so strange, I'm more comfortable around you when I'm naked
Can you hear me? I wonder if you have any mercy, don't torture me
Stop the music, baby
Automatic fool
When it comes to you, I'm automatic, baby
There's no one else like me, I'm the best you'll ever find
No one else could understand you, you're too complex
They say nothing's perfect but they don't know you
It's automatic too, can you hear me?
Honey, I'm so addicted to your pleasure
I'm addicted to your pain
It's automatic

Baby Don't Care
Look girl, what did I tell U? 
No mira, let me tell U something, OK {No look, ...} 
U cannot get something 4 nothing 
U've been lookin' 4 him, U've been takin' good care of him 
Pero oyes, he's never there 4 U so U know? {But listen, ...} 
Mira, yo no tengo tiempo {Look, I have no time} 
Because look, U gotta think of what U want girlfriend 
U gotta remember who U are and where U came from 
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't, baby don't really care 
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't, baby don't really care 
He's got the flava, but let me tell U something 
He ain't no 4ever fella 
So I hear U got another lover, that's what people say 
U and me like sister/brother, that was yesterday 
I only tried 2 teach U one word, that was how 2 stay 
But U dogged me anyway (What did I tell U?) 
CHORUS: 
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't, baby don't really care 
U were bad, but hey 
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't, baby don't really care 
Have dog will stray 
It ain't all that 
So I guess it really made U happy 2 do me like U did 
Weren't U gonna ever tell me or just play me stupid? 
What would U do if me and U would've had a kid? 
I guess U're sorry now (What did I tell U?) 
CHORUS 
It ain't all that, it ain't all that girl 
U gotta think about yourself 
U gotta think about what U wanna do with your furture 
I don't wanna lose U cuz of something I heard 
But every other day I wanna kick your butt 2 the curb 
I found a phone number in your pocket, called up the nerd 
I said ""Smack, smack if I ever see U - word!"" 
When U try 2 lie with those puppy eyes 
I just wanna die cuz U just can't be trusted 
How U try and try, nothing will I buy 
Still U sell and I only get disgusted 
Put it in the bank boy, she don't care! 
Baby don't 
What did I tell U? 
So I don't know what U did 2 make me chase U like I do 
Whatever it is U better keep doing it or I'll catch up with U 
4 all U know I just might have a couple of secrets, ooh! 
Maybe just 1 or 2

824,"Wake up
You're beautiful, loved and blessed
You feel me?
When you found me I was just a piece of clay
I was formless, you gave me a new name
With the breath of life I now live abundantly
All I needed was the potter's hand
And the blood on Calvary
But too much power
Can sometimes turn to shame
Too much desire
Sometimes makes you feel the same
But forgiveness is how you win the game
I begged for truth, now I know the truth
And that is when you came and said I was
Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day before
'Cause you made me confess that I am
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you're free, you're really free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed
A constant battle to stay ahead of the game
Is anybody famous when everybody wants fame?
Always trying to break you down thinkin' that it'll raise 'em up
I just wanna be happy, come, take this bitter cup from me
If I were to ever write down my life story
I could truly say with all the fame and glory
I was just a piece of clay in need of the potter's hand
'Cause when you whispered in my ear
The words I so now understand, oh
Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day before
'Cause you made me confess that I am
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you're free you're really free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed
Everything you made you said, ""That's good""
Before the fall of man you said, ""That's good""
Every time I walk in faith that's good
You let me see another day that's good
Before the earth was made you said
""Tamar, I will lead the way and you'll go far""
Knowledge and understanding
Understanding is good

Was the love that my family showed 
When my mama she passed away 
My papa he gave us hope 
He said there won't ever come a day 
When your family won't help U cope 
As sure as Moses' staff parted the water 
As sure as Cain had 2 pay 4 his crime 
As sure as no one wants 2 be broken hearted 
That's how sure I am that blood is thicker than time

We went 2 church on Sunday mornin' (Oh yeah) 
All dressed up lookin' mighty fine 
The spirit came without a warning 
Intoxicated us all like wine 
Don't it make U stop and wonder 
Why we kill our own kind every day? 
Why can't we get along with each other 
When we   well know it's the only way?

On this chilly, cold afternoon
I overheard the gang in the locker room
Rendezvous, Mary's house
Dirty words and wine
Needless to say, they all spent the day
Just counting time, counting time
Halfway through her history class
Denise, she kindly raised her hand and asked
If she could be excused
(Can I be excused?)
Then she ran from school in a hurry

U should do that, baby - no more will U cry 
The spirit's calling, here's a reason why 
If U had a chance 2 see the future, would U try? 
If U will, so will I 
When I call U up, I wanna tell U what 2 wear 
Don't be surprised if I tell U 2 go bare 
Long as U wash between your soul and through your hair

Around The World In A Day
Condition Of The Heart
There was a girl in Paris whom he sent a letter 2 
Hoping she would answer back now wasn't that a foolhardy notion 
On the part of a sometimes lonely musician? 
Acting out a whim is only good 4 a condition of the heart 
There was a dame from London who insisted that he love her 
Then left him 4 a real prince from Arabia 
Now isn't that a shame 
That sometimes money buys U everything and nothing? 
Love - it only seems 2 buy a terminal condition of the heart 
Oh - thinking about U, driving me crazy 
Oh - my friends all say it's just a phase, but… 
Oh - every day is a yellow day 
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard 
There was a woman from the ghetto 
Who made funny faces just like Clara Bow 
How was I 2 know that she would wear the same cologne as U 
And giggle the same giggle that U do? 
Whenever I would act a fool, the fool with a condition of the heart 
Oh - thinking about U, driving me crazy 
Oh - my friends all say it's just a phase, but… 
Oh - every single day is a yellow day 
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard 
(There was a girl in Paris whom he sent a letter 2)

U keep your mouth shut and stay out of other people's biz 
See, the system wasn't made 4 me or U 
And as a matter of fact, it wasn't made 4 a poor white who... 
Gets their weekly hit 
Or should I say that weekly check 
And start depending on that   like a glass dick 
These are some of the feelings that I'm holdin' 
But everything's fine while I'm rollin'... 
CHORUS 
(Don't everyday) 
How many, how many times must we commit crimes 
Against people no better off than us, but in our own minds? 
A-havin' it, grabbin' it, tastin' it 
And when U step off, I finally rub your face in it 
See, the local's preacher is not suited 4 the have-nots 
The poor get poorer and the rich continue 2 clock ... not! 
That means U end up with the booty 
And we all know a broke man is a man with no friends 
And that's basically the way society is 
And money talk, pusher walk and sleepin' on the politics 
Soon we must live 2 consolidate 
As we continue 2 consume instead of producin', seal our on fate 
(In my deuce and a quarter feelin' funky funky fine) 
People right now really don't give a   
(And I'm rockin' that stupid  ) 
Cuz in the 20 mile radius, there's probably not one black and... 
Hispanic taken 4 granted and left 2 clean their own   up, huh 
No need 4 panic, I'm out 
That's bull !

If I could I would give you the world

Until it reached the banished ones

In this brilliant darkness

And all the rainbow children will stand and fight
For everlasting, everlasting life
For the one who sits on the right
For him we're willing to do the work

They tried to confuse the rainbow children
And dethrone their king
Using the lies promoted by the whose papers
Hella visions, and scagazines
The banished ones constructed a digital garden
Around the palace that extended throughout the world
Furthermore they demanded compensation for their time
Spent in the palace before the exile, this was noise
""So be it"", said the wise one
And gladly obliged with an invisible deed
The banished ones accepted
And returned to their place of birth in mendacity

Sign 'O' The Times
Dorothy Parker
Dorothy Parker    [Controversy Music, ASCAP - 1987]
--------------
Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade
She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips
Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff
In a violent room
Fighting with lovers past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast
Well, I ordered - ""Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't 2 hungry""
Dorothy laughed
She said ""Sounds like a real man 2 me""
Kinda cute, U wanna take a bath?
(do you wanna, do you wanna, bath)
I said ""Cool, but I'm leaving my pants on"" (she say)
""Cuz I'm kind of going with someone""
She said ""Sounds like a real man 2 me""
""Mind if I turn on the radio?""
""Oh, my favorite song"" she said
And it was Joni singing ""Help me I think I'm falling""
(Ring)
The phone rang and she said
""Whoever's calling can't be as cute as U""
Right then I knew I was through
(Dorothy Parker was cool)
My pants where wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie
Cuz she hadn't read the book first
Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha)
I felt much better so I went back 
2 the violent room (tell us what U did)
Let me tell U what I did...
I took another bubble bath with my pants on
All the fighting stopped
Next time I'll do it sooner
This is the ballad of Dorothy Parker

Congratulations, a new star is born
Sun to a shadow, rose to a thorn
There ain't no fury like a woman scorned
Y'all must have dug it, when you did your thang
It's like a song, everybody wanna sang
When the music's over, your ears ring
With a voice that's saying, ""Queen got no King""
He got a message saying, you tried to reach him on the phone
He didn't wanna answer 'cuz he's so afraid
You'd probably tell him just to leave you alone
You must have heard he got another band
They're makin' money, they're makin' plans
You feel left out but you need to understand
Word on the street, he's still your man
He's still your man, he's still your man
Look out, look out, look out, here comes your rainy day
Now you think you got a good reason to say
Everything that's in your heart, come what may
Even though his might get broken
Who's the guilty one when there ain't no judge or jury?
Shadow to the sun, next to the one
Hell ain't got no fury
It will approach us, the debt he's been in
Open to the heart in need of mending
Will this song have a happy ending?
Only the woman knows, only she knows
Two sides to every story
One man's gloom is another man's glory
Sun to a shadow, rose to a thorn
There ain't no fury like a woman scorned
Ain't no fury like a woman scorned

That I was singing and the sound of my voice
Seemed to come from every mountain top
Like it had no choice
And when my voice rose, so did the sun
When the trees sang the harmony as one
Every living soul sang the most beautiful
Melody ever sung

Before the war the only words and language said
Let there be light
Those that can see it are the ones who believe it
And put up no fight
And in the absence of fear and control
Is the sound of the surrendering soul
Louder than the dogmatic persecution
I sing it like you got that right

Go Go Dancer
In the back of my mind, an animalistic ritual 
Me swingin' from a brass pole 
Primal vibe is the way 2 describe {crowd noise in BG} 
Dancin' in my cage, I'm ridin' high 
And there is no one better step 4 stroke 
4 the girl in the cage, there's still hope 
And as U peep the scheme of things 
U'll find U're livin' in my dreams 
Yeah, I'm the go go dancer 
Go go dancer - I'm the life of the party 
Go go dancer - Nothing can stop my body 
Go go dancer - Dancing's all I wanna do 
Caged in a rage, the beat hits 
I step into my 4 by 6 cell now 
Ahh sho'nuff in the house as I elevate 
But in my mouth's a bad taste 
This situation I'm sometimes placed 
Is it art or just a display of 
Flesh contained, slangin' and bangin' 2 a bass drum? 
Silhouetted by lights, caught up in the hype 
I'm doin' my own thing night after night 
Go go dancer - I'm the life of the party 
Go go dancer - Nothing can stop my body 
Go go dancer - Dancing's all I wanna do (G go, G go dancer) 
Crawlin' back and forth, no recourse 
This is it 4 me and my life, yeah, and it's my choice 
Somebody's trippin', I feel myself slippin' away 
Lights flashin', music playin' as I grind in my cage 
Every day and night no matter what I do 
Whether wrong or right, the music makes me ooh 
In the taxi cab, if the radio's on (Go {x12}) 
Off goes the top and I'm goin', goin', goin', gone (Ahh) 
Go go dancer (Ahh) 
Dancer - I'm the life of the party (G go, G go dancer) 
Go go dancer - Nothing can stop my body (Go {x4}) 
Excuse me dandelion, do U wanna dance? 
U know U oughta try it, U might find some new romance 
U know U gotta get wild 2 tolerate this world 2 day 
U gotta do it with style, I got a game - wanna play? 
Go go dancer, go go dancer 
Go go dancer, go go dancer (Ahh) 
Life of the party night after night 
I work my butt off while the women roll their eyes 
And the fellas gawk, yeah 
But it's somethin' that I'm use 2, an occupational hazard 
U see, I do what I gotta do 2 make ends meet 
Yo, I dance and sweat in a cage 2 a go go beat 
Though at times it feels demeaning, this feeling that I'm feeling 
It's a love and hate thing - catch my meaning? (Ahh) 
Go go dancer - I'm the life of the party (G go, G go dancer) 
Go go dancer - Nothing can stop my body (Go)

This is your last chance 
Get on the floor 
I want the whole house dancin' 
Partyup (Uh oh!) Partyup (Uh oh!) 
I love 2 push up when I'm rollin' on the tempo 
Mic in hand, lookin' grand - understand? 
Looks can be deceivin', don't play me soft, I'll rock hard with any man 
Or she-man, hell, 4 that matter 
I gather I'll receive most of my flack from the latter 
People, people, this ain't a sequel 
Just another face U say, but really not an equal 
That's where U're wrong - dead wrong sucker 
U see I'm tired of people singin' the same ole song 
Hard work is how U make it 
Why go half-ass and fake it? 
Worked long and hard, the next plateau is where I'm takin it 
U must always take stock in your self wealth

Uh uh, I don't think so 
Baby, don't play that - besides, not while I'm on a roll 
U stepped left so I left your butt standin' 
Mumblin' on the few words U had left (She left me hangin') 
Hangin's what I'm doin' (Girlfriend, give it 2'em) 
Mama said be nice 2 men, they really don't know what they're doin' 
So I jack 2 the dance floor 
With an individuality U've never seen before 
So keep the beat rockin', clockin' 
The bass is knockin' the walls 
Carmen is answerin' the calls 
Just layin' 4 the moment 2 get ignorant 
Come on C. - Bring in the regiment 
(Witcha bad self) {x2} 
Go on witcha bad self - U know it 
(Witcha bad self) {x2} 
Yeah, I bring it hard, but there's a soft side a bit shy 
A city-fied girl with an innocence that's still purified 
4ever killin' U softly, come love me down 
Never will there be no heartache, baby, when I'm around 
U could say I'm from around the way 
Ask the posse in the hood, they say that ""Baby don't play"" 
Can anyone here rub me the right way? (Oooh) Oooh (Oooh) 
Oops, see what I mean? 
The little girl in me starts teasin' 
Thinkin' of the moment when I am pleasin' 
The right one, whoever that may be 
And when the time comes, he'll be my one and only 
Never spread yourself around or U're bound 2 be held down 
How profound that sounds like love on the rebound 
Imagine, I just pulled this off my shelf 
It was clever - makes me wanna jump back and kiss myself 
 , uh 
Yo, baby's gonna go

I should have contemplated suicide
For the smile upon your face that's well worth keeping
By morning smears for every tear you cry
I could manage a week or to without those kisses
It'd be hard but something tells me, I could try
For that matter, whatever to make you reconsider
Is there truth when you make love to a lie?
Excuse me but is this really goodbye?
Why'd I ever let you in this morning?
Why'd I let you come inside my door?
I should have known without that smile adorning
Your face, a kiss was not what you came for
That's when your hand reached out to touch me gently
At least that's how it happened in my mind
For that matter, whatever to make you reconsider
Is there truth when you make love to a lie?
Excuse me but is this really goodbye?
Can't begin to understand how I think about you
(Everything)
Everything I wanna do, I cannot do without you
However wrong you want, I'll be
Just please don't leave
(Please, don't leave)
If it means this life without you, baby
I swear I'll spend it on my knees
Excuse me but is this really goodbye?
Last night when I left you I was so sure
We'd be together forever and for days
And now my shade of blue couldn't get no bluer
I don't even know what I did to make you go away
I could possibly stage a front and play the cool one

But who would applaud me

Happy Birthday, Mr. Christian

Flying above all fears
Eye haven't seen any tears, not lately
Eye don't wanna land not even maybe
How desperate am eye?
Eye wonder if you r what keeps me alive
Alone eye can't get as high
Even tho eye've tried
It's different when u're grown
The wine don't taste the same
When u're alone
The size of the bed now seems like
The biggest that eye've ever known
[Chorus]
There's so much more 4 you and me 2 explore
Ooh baby baby
When you walk thru that door
Eye am gonna give you what u're waiting 4
Baby lemme break this down
Eye am gonna say this once
Then eye am gonna leave this town
If you can learn 2 open ur eyes under water
Then you and me won't drown
Without each other
Eue promise I'll see you on the other side
Just believe in me and trust this ride
Eye am so sincere right now
Eye just...
Eye just want you here
Eye just want you near me baby
Eye'm scared eye'll cry
And love you like crazy
Eye'm flying above all fears
Eye haven't seen any tears not lately, no
Eye don't wanna land, not even maybe

Here On Earth
Imagine a young woman running 4 her very life
Tryin' 2 get away from the one who loves her
this young woman ur wife
In2 an alley cold and rainy
October just b4 dawn...
Leaping atop a mountain of bricks
her clothes now covered with sick,
The danger hardly gone
She turns and curses the day she met u
and that she wishes she was never born...
Say it's just a dream...
U open up ur eyes and come 2 realize
u simply imagined this
So u lean over and give her a kiss
Here on earth, here on earth,
with u it's not so bad
Here on earth, here on earth

And he doesn't even wear blue jeans 
Why can't he understand what all this means 2 me?

He doesn't listen 2 a word I say 
And he's always tryin' 2 walk me home from school

And I keep it down, you were up in arms
A house full of thieves and liars
A restless heart so easily charmed

And never truly get inside you

It's so bad but I hate you 'cuz you're all that's ever on my mind

I want it to be so good she falls back in love with me

And I want you to pump your hips like you used to

I Hear Your Voice
Out of the lonely blue 
U went away and left me 
(I... I hear your voice) 
Without, without one single word 
(I... I hear your voice) 
Night after night like a ghost from the past 
(I... I hear your voice calling in the night) 
Your voice is all I heard 
I can’t take it, baby (I...) 
Don’t let me die like this
I remember just like it was yesterday 
I woke up, baby, and U were gone 
I didn’t even wanna carry myself up outta bed 
Let alone, I didn’t wanna carry on
Cuz I could hear (I hear your voice calling in the night) 
I can’t stop it no matter how hard I try 
I can hear (I hear your sound calling in the dark) 
In a word, I feel like I wanna die
I started lookin’, lookin’ from dusk till dawn 
4 ways that I wouldn’t miss U so much (I hear your voice) 
I even bought a new dress, uh, but when I put it on 
I could still, huh, still feel your touch
And I can hear (I hear your voice calling in the night) 
I can’t stop it no matter how hard I try 
I can hear (I hear your sound calling in the dark) 
In a word, I feel like I wanna die (I...)
My friends tell me that I need a new love 
A bird in hand beats 2 in the bush (I hear your voice) 
What my friends don’t know, huh, and I ain’t about 2 tell’em 
Is that U’re the only bird, U’re the only one who knows what buttons 2 push
It don’t take no scientist 2 tell U what’s wrong with me 
It don’t take good vision, huh, 2 see what any fool could see 
(I hear your voice calling in the night) 
That I just need your body, I just need your f-f-face 
Right where it counts - no, not in another place 
(I hear your voice calling in the night) 
I’m talkin’ about all up, talkin’ about all down 
Every inch, U see? I don’t need U cross town 
U better read my lips, I need it here with me 
I can’t stop it no matter how I try

Hello, this is Vanity

Yes, but he's taking a shower 
Oh, I see 
Did he just take out the trash? 
No, that's somethin' he use 2 do 
Now he's taking out me 
Oh, I see 
Well, tell 'em he left his pants over here last night 
That's OK, U keep 'em 
He won't be needin' 'em 2 night 
Oh, what's the matter 
Is he going swimming? 
Why no, we was gonna go 
But he said he did that last night

Why don't U bring us your car? 
So sorry baby, but I never go 2 singles' bars 
Singles? Is that what U think?

Oh, he died about 7 years back 
Now ain't that just 2 bad? 
Well, that's how we like 'em - tall, stiff and ready 
That's positively more than I can say 4 dead Jimmy 
That's because he was swallowin' vitamin E

Why don't U just tie a mattress 2 your back? 
I'm gonna need it cuz if I ever see your face 
I'm gonna fall and have a heart attack 
All that's gonna fall is the wig off your head 
Now what U think about that? 
I think I'd rather wear a wig 
Than run a motel 4 roaches, ants and lice 
Dogs and cats in my hat 
Hey, that's goin' 2 far 
Here, give me the phone 
Hey tramp, take a bath in puke 
What's more, U can kiss where the sun don't shine 
If that don't work, we can duke 
U see, the only kinda man that would play with U 
Is one that plays with himself 
None of my friends could stand the sight of U 
Much less the smell 
And if I weren't a lady, I'd take my money 
And buy U a brand new face 
Then I'd take my underwear and stick it in your mouth 
And U'd love it cuz U got no taste 
And if that don't work, call back your dead daddy 
And show him what U look like now 
Honey, I'd bet he never come back 
Cuz U one ugly cow (Ooh-wee) 
Girl, U tell your boyfriend Jimmy he can go and get hit by a car 
Cuz as far as I see it, he can't afford 2 bite the beat of this star

Only best friends can

Would you run to me if somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me?
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be please
If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend would you let me wash your hair?
Could I make you breakfast sometime
Or then, could we just hang out, I mean
Could we go to a movie and cry together

Maybe you think I'm being a little self-centered
I, I said, ""I want to be all of the things you are to me""

You are flyin' aboard the Seduction 747
And this plane is fully equipped
With anything your body desires
If for any reason there is a loss in cabin pressure
I will automatically drop down to apply more
To activate the flow of excitement
Extinguish all clothing materials and pull my body close to yours
Place my lips over your mouth and kiss, kiss, normally
In the event there is over excitement
Your seat cushion may be used as a flotation device
We ask that you please observe the 'No letting go' sign
I anticipate a few turbulence along the way
We are now makin' our final approach to satisfaction
Please bring your lips, your arms, your hips
Into the upright and locked position
For landing, can you feel it, can you feel it?
Yeah
Welcome to Satisfaction
Please remain awake until the aircraft
Has come to a complete stop

And as sure as this candle burns

Jerk Out
I got real bored on a Friday night 
I couldn't find a   thing 2 do 
So I pulled out a suit 
About the same color as my BMW 
I drove 2 the party and I pimped on in 
Just 2 see what I could see 
Everybody knew what I was lookin' 4 
I was lookin' 4 some company 
I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar 
She looked kinda all alone 
So I pimped on over and I asked her name 
The child was bad 2 the bone 
I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek 
The only kind of rap it takes 
She knew I was bad when I pulled out a leash 
She said, ""How much money U make?"" 
Jerk it, jerk it 
Talkin' about the jerk out 
Jerk it, jerk it 
Talkin' about the jerk out 
I took her 2 my crib and I tied her up 
I figured that's what she liked 
Maybe I was wrong but what the hell 
It didn't matter 2 me - she was white 
I said ""How come people in your neighborhood 
Don't like it when a brother's rich? 
Ain't my blood the same color as yours? 
Answer that question,  !"" 
It just pisses U off 2 see me drivin' that fancy car, don't it? 
Bet U'd rather see me drivin' one of those [ester grate ones] 
Like the one your daddy drives, wouldn't U? 
Let me tell U one thing - that's dead! 
About as dead as U'll be if U don't rearrange your brain 
Catch my drift? 
Turn it up! 
Oh, nasty me! 
Girl, U think U wanna turn it up? 
Where's my checkbook? 
That's right, check it out 
An awful lot of O's, wouldn't U say? (Mm hmm!) 
Hit it 
Cross over, uh! 
(Ooh, [thunder]) {x2} 
Turn it up 
Jerk out - Jerkin' everything in sight 
Jerk out - Got 2 make some love 2night 
Jerk out 
Don't cha all just hate it when we walk into y'all's joint 
And just jerk out everything in sight? 
Don't it make U mad? (Jerk out) {x2} 
It'd make me mad! 
Everybody in the house say ""Jerk out"" (Jerk out) 
""Ow!"" (Ow!) 
Say ""Jerk out"" (Jerk out) 
""Ow!"" (Ow!) 
Everybody say ""Jerk out"" (Jerk out)

Which coat should I wear 2night? 
If U think I'm vain, U're right 
Look out, somebody say ""Vanity"" (Vanity) 
Jerk out (Jerk out) {x8} 
Ow! (Ow!) {x2} 
Everybody jerk out and do it right 
I'm talkin' 'bout the jerk out 
Oh Lord, hey yeah 
Got 2 make some love 2 night 
I'm master of the jerk out 
Jerkin' everything in sight 
I'm talkin' 'bout the jerk out, Lord yeah

Pimps and thangs like to hang outside

Four letter words are seldom heard
With such dignity and bite
All the poets and the part time singers
Always hang inside
Live music from a band plays a song called
'Soul Psychodelicide'
The song's a year long and had been playing four months
When he walked into the place
No one seemed to care, an introverted 'this is it' look
On most of their faces
Up on the mic repeating two words over and over again
Was this woman he had never noticed before
He lost himself in the articulated manner in which
She said them these two words
A little bit behind the beat
I mean just enough to turn you on
For everytime she said the words
Another one of his doubts were gone
Should he try to rap with her?
Should he stand and stare?
No one else was watching her
She didn't seem to care
So over and over, she said the words
'Til he could take no more
He dragged her from the stage, together they ran
Through the back door
In the alley over by the curb
He said, ""Tell me, what's your name""?
She only said the words again

Two words falling between the drops
And the moans of his condition
Holding someone is truly believing

Just A Little Lovin'
Carmen 
""What U gonna play now?"" 
(Tasty) {repeat throughout song in BG} 
(Let me ..) 
Just a little lovin' early in the mornin' 
Mmm, mmm 
Flavors - so many flavors 2 choose from 
All delectable in their way, it's very hard 2 choose just one 
So as I think slowly and try 2 decide 
Out of all the lovely treats, just which one am I? 
It's hard 2 say cuz I'm a special blend 
People will try 2 put me in 
A category 4 which there is no room 4 expansion 
Don't U see that move is doubtful? 
Because the fruit is bountiful 
Turn me over slowly and I guarantee a mouthful 
Just a little lovin' early in the mornin' 
Easy does it, take your time 
Tasty - now U know the meaning of the line 
Just a little lovin' early in the mornin' 
And now that U've had a taste, could U waste a dropful? 
Of a nectar so sweet guaranteed 2 keep U youthful 
A hot tasty hors d'oeuvre 
Or better yet, what would U prefer? 
Hot fudge over ice   topped with whipped  ? 
Passion is in the fruit and I can't stand it 
If it could be bottled, people would be demanding it 
And that would be just 2 scandalous 
Just a little lovin' early in the mornin' 
So as I simmer basted with a touch of honey 2 give me a glimmer 
Or should I say shimmer of sweetness 
Pound 4 pound I can see no weakness 
(Oh glory) Glory 2 the Father 
If U think U're praising me then don't even bother 
Excuse me, I don't think they heard me 
Turn it up a little louder 
Cool - here we go 
Just a little lovin' early in the mornin' 
Hmmm, I'm feelin' effervescent, refreshed, lively 
Never mind - girlfriend over there who despises me 
She doesn't even know my name 
That's OK, U should have an attitude when U play this game 
These days it's very hard 2 be chosen 
Cuz most of us try 2 play like ice cubes frozen 
But that'll get U nut n' honey 
Guitar man, give me something yummy 
Just a little lovin' early in the mornin' {x3} 
So as the aromas fill the room 
And the smell of sugar and cinnamon looms 
Aromatic in its blend 
And there's plenty 4 U 2 choose from on the menu my friends 
So take your time 
And every now and then try something different and U'll find 
Variety is the spice of life that keeps it finger-lickin' 
Ah, that wasn't no ordinary chicken 
Ha, ha, ha, U better believe it 
And at this moment I think it's time I release it 
Peace (Mmm) 
Just a little lovin' early in the mornin'

The apple of my daddy's eye
Cute but not jaded my hair in two braids
He looked at me and just said hi
Was it his cologne or the style of his hair?
They told me I should stay away and not go there
Sometimes I'm all alone and don't see him
I wish it was different but I don't care
I'm a kept woman, he don't see nobody but me
We got a pretty little house and only me and him got the key
A kept woman, sometimes I don't know why
A kept woman, sometimes I cry
He likes it when I dance for no reason
He likes it when I dance
But he doesn't like it when I raise my voice to him
I try to stop but I can't
Was it his cologne or the style of his hair?
I don't know how but he took me there
And now I hug my pillow more nights than not
It's crazy but the butterflies just don't stop
'Cause I'm a kept woman, he don't see nobody but me
We got a pretty little house and only me and him got the key
A kept woman, sometimes I don't know why
A kept woman, sometimes I cry
Kept woman, kept woman, he's the hotness in my fire
I give him anything he desires
It may sound crazy but it suits me fine
'Cause ain't nobody ever take away what's mine
I'm a kept woman 'cause he's every single thing I need

To get through this thing called life
Electric word life it means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else
The afterworld, a world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left?
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life things are much harder than in the afterworld
This life you're on your own
And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy punch a higher floor
If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you at least you got friends
Come on lady for friendly word
She picked up the phone, dropped it on the floor
Ahh, ahh is all I heard
Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down, oh, no let's go
Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go
All excited but we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause we're all gonna die
And when we do, what's it all for
Better live now before the grim reaper
Come knocking on your door
Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down, oh, no let's go
Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go
Come on baby let's get nuts

On the block lookin' hot like it's early June
At the top shinin' bright something like the moon
Can you picture with my lyrics bumpin' my cartoons
With my ace cause we're queens so we never get carded
Kill the scene then we leave call it “dearly departed”

The press will turn it into a show
Everyone expecting this outcome
Still they jump for all the clues
I guess I should be happy but I'm still not sure
That you really love me
Love me, love me, love me, you love me
Like the lion of Judah
I'll strike my enemies down
As my God is living
Surely the trumpet will sound
There was one who would stand by my side
Through the the good and the bad
Let that one stand with pride
The best that I've ever had
Like the lion of Judah
Driving away with a smile on my face
Wind blowing through my hair
Wondering how you'll feel when you find out
How much I really care
Hoping that the tears roll down your face
Your body grasp who we are, who are we?
Two gypsy beggars who only
By Vegas came to be a star
A super star, a star, that's what we are
Like the lion of Judah
I'll strike my enemies down
As my God is living
Surely the trumpet will sound

Besides, you know it takes awhile for me to do my hair
Come on get lost in the mellow, mellow
Come on get lost in the mellow, mellow

Just you and me in the mellow of my mind
I wanna get lost in the composition of you
Let the rhythm play only the notes you want me to
I'm a good learner and once I understand
I'll stand under you and let you show me
How you want your man to be
I could dance for you a little comical minuet
If you desire I'll shed my attire, anything to get you wet
Shower, my flower?
So much to do, so little time
So choose wisely and you can find thee
In the mellow of my mind
Come on get lost in the mellow, mellow
Come on get lost in the mellow, mellow

Are U ready baby? (Ooh)

It's all I can do not to stare

Now I don't wanna put to you to sleep with a bunch of chatter
And a rap that really don't matter
But now that you know who I am, you need to make plans
And all your other pennies should scatter
A limousine about to pick you up
And then take you to a private jet too fine
And then you gonna meet a little Spanish man
Who will offer you wine and MoÃ«t
In an hour or two, you'll be taken to a suite
That will rock all your wildest dreams
And on the bed, three dresses to choose one, pick one
Then you get a call from me
Tell me which dress you chose
So I can put on, put on my matchin' suit
All the real guys, throw your hands up
You know how Mr. Goodnight do
Call Mr. Goodnight, he'll make you feel alright
Make you throw your head back and holla, he's so nice, so nice

Just can't keep a secret 'bout Goodnight, Goodnight

I got a mind full of good intentions
And a mouth full of raisenets

Before we convene in the pool

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
I did not come to funk around
'Til I get your daughter I won't leave this town
In the beginning God made the sea
But on the 7th day he made me
He was tryin' to rest y'all
When He heard the sound
Sound like a guitar, cold gettin' down
I tried to bust a high note
But I bust a string
My God was worried
'Til he heard me sing
My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
Hurt me

My name is Prince and I am funky
When it come to funk I am a junky
I know from righteous, I know from sin
I got two sides and they're both friends
Don't try to clock 'em, they're much too fast
If you try to stop 'em they kick that ass
Without a pistol, without a gun
When you hear my music you'll be havin' fun
That's when I gottcha
That's when you mine
To tell the truth
Tell me what's my line?

Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
My name is Prince, I don't wanna be king
'Cause I've seen the top and it's just a dream
Big cars and women and fancy clothes
Will save your face but it won't save your soul
I'm here to tell you that there's a better way
Would our Lord be happy if He came today?
I ain't sayin' I'm better, no better than you
But if you want to play with me, you better learn the rules
My name is Prince and I am funky

The funkier I be, the funkier I get, oh  
Lickety split on the lyric, a new jack in the pulpit
Watch it deacon, your track is leakin'
What is this you're seekin'?
The syncopated rhymes are at their peak
When you jumped on my D I C K
That's the one thing that I don't play
The jock strap was too big for you anyway
You're just a simpleton, I'll bust you like a pimple, son
My star is too bright
Boy, I'll sink you like the ship, Poseidon Adventure
You're bumpin' dentures to be cocksure
There must be more coming from your mouth than manure
So with a flow and a spray, I say
""Hey, you must become a prince before you're king anyway""
Do that, do that somebody
Do that, do that somebody
It's time to get ig-ig-ignorant
Def be the beat that I'm rockin'
Yo so, come get a hit
And put your thinking cap on, you've been forewarned
I call upon the inner forces that I've got brewin' in my cauldron
That means my nugget, sometimes I'm rugged
The style I posses be havin', the other brothers buggin'
And this is for those who oppose
To propose to overexpose disclose
Pose a threat to my brother
Like any other man makin' a stand
I'll be  ed if I let you play this hand
I'm the blackjack dealer and the cards are stacked
What do you expect to win when you're used to playing craps?
Do that, do that somebody
Do that, do that somebody
It's gettin' tricky, I mean it's a sticky situation
To resurrect a groove with feeling and give it this much affection
Passion flows and who knows what lurks in the gallows of my mind
I put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow
12 inches of non-stop sole
I'm on a roll with P, it's time for the show
So do that, do that somebody
Wave your hands in the air
This is a   ing party
While you're laying back I'm on the attack paddywhack
Give yourself a bone
This is my house and I'm prone
To layin' some chrome upside some   ers dome

'Cause an old friend of mine got lost in the jive
Little did she know, when you're stuck in the snow
Nobody gets out alive
Tears fall gently in my garden
As I wait in vain for my sweet baby to call
I guess what my own brother told me was true
He had been with my sweet baby
And she never really loved me at all
Night fell so dark this evenin'
The moon wasn't shining' nowhere
Sometimes that old light in the alley
Would light up this old heart of mine
But now I'm wonderin'
If there's someone up there who really cares
The night fell darkest in Persia
What used to flow blue is now flowin' black
Many a doctor can try but only heaven knows why
When it comes to love
Why do some men, why do some men turn their backs?
Can't somebody please tell me?
Maybe the morning air will make me feel better
Oh, I hope, better than I feel right now
Last night a stranger took my picture
And then he, uh, he asked if I'd buy it
Huh, I said, ""I guess I don't know how""

Nuestra presentacion especial comenzara en breve 
{Our special presentation will start shortly} 
Pero antes un mensaje de nuestros auspiciadores 
{But first a message from our sponsors} 
Uh, yeah 
Uh 
Good mornin' ladies and gentlemen (""What hotel number is she in?"") 
Boys and   in' girls (""319, 319"" ""Cool"") 
This is your captain with no name speakin' 
And I'm here 2 rock your world 
With a tale that will soon be classic 
About a woman U already know 
No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain 
 Control (Are U ready?) 
Aaah,  Control, oh 
Aaah,  Control, oh 
Our story begins in a schoolyard 
A little girl skipping rope with her friends 
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket 
Just school books 4 the fight she would be in 
One day over this hoodie 
She got beat 4 some clothes and a rep 
With her chin up, she scolded ""All y'all's molded 
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step"" 
And step she did 2 the straight A's 
Then college, a master degree 
She hired the heifers that jumped her 
And made everyone of them work 4 free? 
No! Why? 
So what if my sisters are triflin'? 
They just don't know 
She said ""Mama didn't tell'em what she told me 
'Girl, U need  Control'"" (Are U ready?) 
Aaah,  Control, oh 
Aaah,  Control, oh 
Verse 2 
 got bank in her pockets 
Before she got dick in her drawers 
If brother didn't have good 'n' plenty of his own 
In love  never did fall 
And this fool named Trick wanna stick her 
Uh, talkin' more   than a bit 
'Bout how he gonna make  a star 
If she come and sing a lick on his hit 
 said "" a, U crazy if U don't know 
Every woman in the world ain't a freak 
U can go platinum 4 times 
Still couldn't make what I make in a week 
So push up on somebody that wanna hear that 
Cuz this somebody here don't wanna know 
Boy, U better act like U understand 
When U roll with  Control"" (Are U ready?) 
Aaah,  Control, oh 
Aaah,  Control, oh 
Breakdown 
(Are U ready 4 the best  U ever felt?) {x2} 
With one more verse 2 the story 
I need another piece of your ear 
I wanna hip U all 2 the reason 
I'm known as the Player of the Year 
Cuz I met this girl named  
At the club - International Balls 
She was rollin' 4-deep 
3 sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl drivin' a Hog 
I pulled up right beside her 
And my electric top went down 
I said ""  er, I know your reputation 
And I'm astounded that U're here 
I fear U're lonely and U want 2 know 
A 12 o'clock straight up  a 
That don't give a   that U're  Control 
Well I'm that  a, at least I wanna be 
But it's gonna be hard as hell 
2 keep my mind off a body 
That would make every rich man 
Want 2 sell, sell, sell (75, we need another.. 85, 85 here, sold!) 
Can I tell U what I'm thinkin' that U already know? 
U need a   er that respects your name"" 
Now say it,  Control (Are U ready?) 
Aaah,  Control, oh 
Aaah,  Control, oh 
And the moral of this   er is 
Ladies, make'em act like they know 
U are, was, and always will be  Control (Are U ready?) 
Peace and be wild (Aaah,  Control) 
Say what, huh? (Oh) 
Oh no, don't U think about callin' her a ho (Are U ready?) 
U juvenile delinquent 
Best sit your ass down 
Talkin' about  Control 
Huh, can U dig it? 
Aaah,  Control (Are U ready?) 
Oh (Are U ready?) 
Aaah,  Control (Are U ready?)

First he crucified every dandelion out in the yard
Then he s ed at baby twice for throwin' rocks at passin' cars
Baby didn't listen, so like a priceless work of art
He got snatched by his papa who then opened up the closet door
And pushed the four year old down, onto the closet floor
Baby cried ""I'm sorry, I won't do it no more""
Papa said ""Yeah, I know, that's what this here's for""
Smack, papa
Smack, smack, papa, papa
Smack, papa
Smack, smack, papa, papa
As the door closes, baby starts to cry
""Please don't lock me up again, without a reason why""
Papa just went outside and pointed a shotgun up in the sky
He said ""How come I don't love my woman?""
Then he took aim and died
Boom, papa
Boom, boom, papa, papa
Boom, papa
Boom, boom, papa, papa
Don't abuse children, or else they turn out like me
Fair to partly crazy, deep down we're all the same
Every single one of us knows some kind of pain
In the middle of all that's crazy, this one fact still remains

You gotta get your peace on

That's what we're here for
And not to war 
When the war upon people of color thru needles
Designed to disease instead of relieve 
When it ceases

Like tears on the face of Coretta 
Roll down and go away
I'll be happier

Whether or not it destroy or transcend
Then I won't need

Yeah man I wanna talk, but I dunno

Here she come, dressed in red
Get her done, is all that's in my head
Her hot pants can't hide her cheeks

Lest they die of old age

So there U are 
About time U showed up 
Yea, I know what U heard 
But let me talk
Baby, take a look outside your window 
And see your future standing there 
I've been here 4 a while now, baby 
Or maybe U weren't aware 
I knew that U heard every single story 
About all the friends that I've got 
But baby, if U give me 7 years of your time 
All the friends I would have not
CHORUS: 
Player - If I had U girl, I wouldn't be one 
Player - If U'd let me in the mix, we could have fun 
Player - If life was a movie, U'd have the main part 
Girl, U're number one with a bullet on my charts
Don't make me say I need U like a begger man 
Why don't U let me come inside? 
I'm the type of male that a girl like U is in need of 
Sho' U right 
I could take U sailing in a glass bottom boat 
U could drink wine while I read poems that I wrote
I'm sick of fishing in the big sea, baby 
I wanna check out the settling down 
I wanna dock my boat in your fairway 
In your kisses I wanna drown {x3}
CHORUS
If I had U girl, I wouldn't be one
Friends, whatever they told U, they lied 
My life's an open book, I ain't got nothing 2 hide 
I need U like a begger, yeah, I got no pride 
Open your heart, let me come inside
CHORUS
Baby, take a look outside your window 
And see your future standing there 
I've been here 4 a while now, baby 
Or maybe U wouldn't care 
I knew that U heard every single story 
About all the friends that I've got 
But baby, if U give me 7 years of your time 
All the friends I will have not
Player - If I had U girl, I wouldn't be one

Pride And The Passion
In a flash, he caught her eye 
He was everything she was lookin' 4 
He had big cash and a Brando smile 
He was pretty easy 2 adore 
She tried her luck, huh, I mean she played the man 
She sho'nuff thought she could turn him on 
But she got (stuck) stuck when he kissed her hand 
And told her that he wanted 2 take her home 
Pride and the passion 
Laugh all night, cry all day 
If true love is old-fashioned 
Should we pass or should we play? 
In a flash, her life had changed (Life had changed) 
Everything she feared was put on trial (Everything was put on trial) 
Priorities rearranged (Rearranged) 
She said she had 2 have him 4 a little while 
And if he's good, he can teach her things (He can teach her things) 
Things about herself that she never knew 
And if he's the one, the shining armor knight 
Think of all the dirty things they could do 
CHORUS: 
Pride and the passion 
Laugh all night, cry all day 
Cuz if true love is old-fashioned 
Should we pass or should we play? 
What's it gonna be? 
The pride or the passion, passion, passion? 
In a flash, she took a chance 
She let him take her 2 his crib 
Music played, they started 2 dance 
She said she really dug his ad-lib 
What went down I don't wanna say (I don't wanna say) 
Destiny is yours, don't let it fool ya 
And if U're wrong, expect a massive drag 
If U're right, more power 2 ya

Stick pin jab in the middle of a dream 
No love at the end of the rainbow

Circles my heart danced

She was only 14, but she had the major body

We took her 4 a ride in Ace's car, the music started 2 play 
We sat real close, both nervous 
Lookin' at each other not knowin' what 2 say 
Carrie was a sister 
But her eyes kinda made her look Japanese 
Her short cut afro, shiny and soft 
Her clothes fit 2 please

Snow Man
Christmas in Belgium was different 
Than the ones spent in L.A. 
The Christmas I got no presents 
Still me and my brother played 
Near the ocean makin' the snow man 
On his face we were makin' a smile 
Cuz just like a daddy 
The snow man had style 
CHORUS: 
Snow man, snow man 
Another Christmas gone 
I got a chess game this time 
A bishop takes the pawn 
Sometimes I wanna go back where 
The ocean swallows the shore 
I could still see him smiling 
When my snow man is no more, no more 
Winter seldom passing 
Where the memory doesn't sway 
2 the smell of a Christmas dinner 
Shared the family way (Shared in the family way) 
Everything seems so perfect 
That nothing would dare go wrong 
But tears come with the summer 
So long, so long (So long)

Will they ever make anyone smile

31,"Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life is never ending
All good things, they say, never last
Springtime was always my favorite time of year
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry for love, never cry for pain
He used to say so strong ""Oh I'm not afraid to die
I'm afraid of the death that left me hypnotized""
Now, staring at his picture I realize
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
All good things, they say, never last
I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
But all good things, they say, never last
And all good things they say, never last
And love, just isn't love until it's passed",prince,sometimes it snows in april,1986,Parade,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

895,"Dear Future Generations,
I think I speak for the rest of us when I say,
sorry, sorry we left you our mess of a planet.
Sorry that we were too caught up in our own doings to do something.
Sorry we listened to people who made excuses,
to do nothing.
I hope you forgive us,
we just didn't realize how special the earth was,
like a marriage going wrong,
we didn't know what we had until it was gone.
For example,
I'm guessing you probably know what is the Amazon Desert, right?
Well believe it or not,
it was once called once called the Amazon Rain forest,
and there were billions of trees there,
and all of them gorgeous and just um.
Oh, you don't know much about trees, do you?
Well let me tell you that trees are amazing,
and I mean, we literally breath the air
they are creating, and they clean up our pollution,
our carbon, store and purify water,
give us medicine that cures ours diseases, food that feeds us.
Which is why I am so sorry, to tell you that,
we burned them down.
Cut them down with brutal machines, horrific,
at a rate of 40 football fields every minute,
that's 50% of all the trees in the world all gone
in the last 100 years.
Why? For this.
and that wouldn't make me so sad,
if there weren't so many pictures of leaves on it.
You know when I was a child,
I read how the Native Americans had such consideration,
for the planet that they felt responsible,
for how they left the land for the next 7 generations.
Which brings me great sorrow, because most of us today,
don't even care about tomorrow.
So i'm sorry, i'm sorry that we put profit over people,
greed over need, the rule of gold above the golden rule.
I'm sorry we used nature as a credit card with no spending limit.
Over drafting animals to extinction,
stealing your chance to ever see their uniqueness,
or become friends with them.
Sorry we poison the ocean so much that you can't even swim in them.
But most of all, i'm sorry about our mindset,
cause we had the nerve to call this destruction,
progress.
Hey Fox News, if you don't think climate change is a threat.
I dare you to interview the thousands of homeless people in Bangladesh,
see while you was in your penthouse nessel,
their homes were literally washed away
beneath their feet due to the rising sea levels,
and Sara Palin, you said that you love the smell of fossil fuels,
well i urge you to talk to the kids of Beijing
who are forced to wear pollution masks just to go to school.
You see you can ignore this, but the thing about truth is,
it can be denied, not avoided.
so i'm sorry future generation,
i'm sorry that our footprints became a sinkhole and not a garden.
I'm sorry that we paid so much attention to ISIS,
and very little how fast the ice is melting in the arctic.
I'm sorry we doomed you
and i'm sorry we didn't find another planet in time to move to.
I ams...
You know what, cut the beat, i'm not sorry.
This future I do not accept it,
because a error does not become a mistake,
until you refuse to correct it,
we can redirect this, how?
Let me suggest that if a farmer sees a tree that is unhealthy,
they don't look at the branches to diagnosis it,
they look at the root, so like that farmer,
we must look at the root,
and not to the branches of the government,
not to the politicians runs by corporations
we are the root, we are the foundation, this generation,
it is up to us to take care of this planet.
it is our only home, we must globally warm our hearts
and change the climate of our souls
and realize that we are not apart from nature,
we are a part of nature.
and to betray nature is to betray us,
to save nature, is to save us,
because whatever you're fighting for,
Racism, poverty, feminism, gay rights,
or any type of equality.
it won't matter in the least,
because if we don't all work together to save the environment,
we will be equally extinct.

First was Kevin, then came Lucy, third in line was me
All of us where ordinary compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line, a smile beneath her nose
Her favorite number was 20 and every single day
If you asked her what she had for breakfast, this is what she'd say
Starfish and coffee, maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine and a side order o' ham
If you set your mind free, baby, maybe you'd understand

Cynthia wore the prettiest dress, with different color socks
Sometimes I wondered if the mates where in her lunch box
Me and Lucy opened it when Cynthia wasn't around
Lucy cried, I almost died, you know what we found

In another dream of you, all night long
Out of town, I had to go but now
I need a cup of somethin' black and strong
Beside me, I was just awaken up
With you here, now you're gone
Why oh why didn't you hurry along
With me this time? Right or wrong
As a matter of fact, I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you, babe
When we're together, everything is cool
Beautiful lover, friend, I'll never leave you again
You and me, we're sticky like glue
Bright blue eyes staring down into mine saying
""Good morning, how are you?""
I can't lie, wakin' up in a plane
Without a warning, ain't too cool
Cast ashore without a paddle
And no more excuses, we just drown
What's the score? If you still really wanna
Be my muse then come around
As a matter of fact I just can't live without you, babe
I'm wonderin' if you feel the same way too
I'm huggin' this pillow tight, the way we did last night
The sweat of each other, sticky like glue
Sticky, sticky, 1, 2
That was the coolest movie ever
The one we saw last night
The closer you got to me
The less we saw, alright
The scene you remember the most is none of 'em
That ain't a boast, girl
I'm just in front of them others, I'm a gracious host
Everybody under me, make a toast

I can't get to sleep unless your body
Unless your body is right here next to me

But I, I, I, I just can't, can't see myself
Myself with another, girl

I don't know what's wrong with me, babe
Tell me what to do, is it me or you?
We fight so much and then we're through
It might come as a shock to you
But I, I, I, I, I still love you, yes, I do
Sticky like glue, sticky, sticky
Don't you think I ain't when I am?
One more thing and then I'm out
You get us wet with your pride
Then you hang us both outside to cry, cry
What's that sound?

Supercute
She arrived on a 74
/About 20 to 11 
She comes to see him, him as in me
She comes to see 
And it's never complicated
Other women cannot fade it 
Whenever I call
She gets dressed up and all
Supercute 
CHORUS 
Maybe it's cause she comes from East L.A.
But every time I see her body on display 
I gotta call her name from the DJ  booth
Strobe light flash and you know the truth 
Baby got game, she'll take your loot
Keys to the crib with no dispute 
See her dancing in her birthday suit - Supercute 
Together we wonder how we got enslaved and why 
(It's time to get freedom for our people)
Jericho falls when we all discern the lie 
Yo, why the man wanna lie?
I look at her eyes go wild, she smiles - Supercute 
CHORUS 
On a dare I wanna see if she will share
The kinda toys she uses when I'm not there 
None at all she swears
I don't care 
(I don't care ) 
I make her buy another one 
And a new dress to wear
(vibrator noise) 
Goes the toy against her curly hair
Now she must confess 
How she really like to play
Or if she don't, I lower the speed 
And bad words she'll say
Tell me how you play, how you play 
Even in her anger she's still
Supercute

The Ballad Of Dorothy Parker
Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade 
She worked the night shift 
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine 
She got a lot of tips 
Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff in a violent room 
Fightin' with lover's past 
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine 
Dorothy was fast 
Well, I ordered - ""Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't 2 hungry"" 
Dorothy laughed 
She said - ""It sound like a real man 2 me (U're kinda cute) 
U're kinda cute, U wanna take a bath?"" (Do U wanna, do U wanna?) ... Bath? 
Oh, I said - ""Cool, but I'm leavin' my pants on (What U say?) 
Cuz I'm kinda goin' with someone"" 
She said - ""Sound like a real man 2 me 
Mind if I turn on the radio?"" 
""Oh, my favorite song,"" she said 
And it was Joni singing, ""Help me, I think I'm falling"" 
(Drring) The phone rang and she said 
""Whoever's calling can't be as cute as U"" 
Right then and there I knew I was through (Dorothy Parker was cool) 
Well 
My pants were wet, they came off 
But she didn't see the movie cuz she hadn't read the book first 
Instead she pretended she was blind 
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse 
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha, ha ha) 
I felt much better so I went back 2 the violent room 
(Tell us what U did, what U did) Let me tell U what I did 
I took another bubble bath with my pants on 
All the fighting stopped 
Next time I'll do it sooner 
This is the ballad of Dorothy Parker 
(Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker)

The Belle Of St. Mark
The Belle of St. Mark was a frail but a passionate creature 
Ebony hair and eyes a deep blue-green 
The Belle of St Mark wore clothes that belonged 2 his father 
Even though he was only 17 
CHORUS: 
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the Belle of St. Mark 
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry 
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the Belle of St. Mark 
And if he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die 
U can tell from expressions that he makes public 
That he suffers from a badly broken heart 
He smiles as he feeds the afternoon pigeons 
But he cries as he walks the night streets of St. Mark 
CHORUS 
The Belle of St. Mark, he don't talk 2 strangers, he's so mysterious 
His erotic persuasion provokes me like no other man 
The fire I have 4 him is undoubtedly serious 
I need 2 make him see that he needs love 2 forget 
And if anyone can help him, I can 
I can help, I can help U 
His Paris hair, it blows in the warm Parisian air 
That blows whenever his Paris hair is there 
The woman that hurt him surely must have trouble sleeping 
Cuz the Belle of St. Mark is a beauty extraordinaire 
Oh, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the Belle of St. Mark 
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry 
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the Belle of St. Mark 
And if he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die 
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the Belle of St. Mark 
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry 
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the Belle of St. Mark 
And if he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die 
And if he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die 
And if he don't... I'll die",prince,the belle of st mark,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I knew this dude/He was very cool 
He used 2 rule/Until he went 2 school 
Not a normal school/That breeds a fool 
But the ones that teaches/Men aren't fit to rule 
That's when he took his pearly crown/He raised it up and spun it 'round 
And tossed in2 the deep blue underground 
No longer lead by the ways of men/He looked 4 the kingdom deep within 
That's when the drums in his head began 2 pound

He taught an integrated world 2 sing

Everybody's a star all the everyday people sang

Then he changed the colors of the flag 
But u can't teach a dog new tricks if his tail don't wag

The Glamorous Life
She wears a long fur coat of mink 
Even in the summertime 
Everybody knows from the coy little wink 
The girl's got a lot on her mind 
She's got big thoughts, big dreams 
And a big brown Mercedes sedan 
What I think this girl, she really wants 
Is 2 be in love with a man 
She wants 2 lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants 2 lead the glamorous life 
Without love, it ain't much 
She saw him standing in the section marked 
""If U have 2 ask, U can't afford it"" lingerie 
She threw him bread and said ""Make me s "" 
In the dark, what could he say 
Boys with small talk and small minds 
Really don't impress me in bed 
She said I need a man's man baby, diamonds and furs 
Love would only conquer my head 
She wants 2 lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants 2 lead the glamorous life 
Without love, it ain't much 
They made haste in the brown sedan 
They drove 2 55 Secret Street 
They made love and by the 7th wave

She thought real love is real scary 
Money only pays the rent

If we drown then we'll be delivered
You can still see the picture upon the wall
One eye staring at nothing at all
The other one trying to focus through all your tears
You can try and try but there's nothin' to hide
You can't run from yourself and what's inside
You got to find the answers to the questions that you most fear
So over and over you ask your soul
Why'd you come down to a world so cold?
And the voice inside says, tonight the truth will be told
You surrounded yourself with all the wrong faces
Spending your time in all the wrong places
Puttin' your faith in things that only make you cry
People say, they love you when they wanna help
But how can they when you can't help yourself?
The more they say they love you, the more you just wanna die
So here we go again, the self analysis
Have another glass of port and uh, forget this
The band's playin' at the club tonight and they're bound to groove
There you are, you think you're high
You can't ask yourself 'cuz you'd only lie
If you had a dollar for every time you tried
You can't call nobody 'cuz they'll tell you straight up
Come and make love when you really hate 'em

They're over and done

You'll never get another glimpse
I'm going to lace her with enough ice to recap the pole
There might be another solar eclipse
She's gonna find bath water
Bath water hot enough to be touched
I'm gonna put her on the same diet Missy went on
You know she eat to much
Tonight, she's gonna miss you at first
But then she'll get used to me
All of the tricks I would try
To make her take this ring and make love to me

Backtrack along with me 
Through those old sweet melodies 
Turn the radio on 
They're playing the old songs 
How they bring back memories 
Of the way love used 2 be 
It was all so simple then 
Slow dancing there in the den 
2 the tune ""Blowing In The Wind"" 
Scanning through The Hit Parade 
Hanging out at the record shop 
Learning how 2 do the cha-cha-cha 
Back when Sam Cooke was hot 
Twisting the night away (away)

""Twist And Shout"" and ""The Duke Of Earl""

The Work Pt. 1
Every time I watch the other people news
I c a false picture of myself, another one of u
They try 2 tell us what we want, what 2 believe
Didn't that happen in the Garden
When somebody spoke 2 Eve?
But I'm willing 2 do The Work
Willing 2 do what I gotta do
I'm willing 2 do The Work
Tell me now - what about u?
Look around and tell me ur Sun is Risen
When ur brothers and sisters r in the Fall
What is left 2 give when r work is done?
What do we own besides the right 2 crawl?
C we're living in a system that the devil designed
And suffering from this devil's most heinous crime
He's tried 2 keep us from the reason we were born
That is 2 b the living truth in human 4m
But I'm willing 2 do The Work
Willing 2 do what I gotta do
I'm willing 2 do The Work
Tell me now - what about u?
This work is not an easy task
But this is the work we must do 4 Revelation 2 come 2 pass
This work is the kind that turns ur back on the Ruling Class
By putting them in their place just like the past
Taste it, ain't it sweet sweet?
Gotta lotta work 2 do
Taste it, ain't it sweet sweet?
Gotta lotta work 2 do
Nothing can stop us
Whatever's in r way
We got 2 go thru it 2 get 2 it

U Make My Sun Shine
Come on over here baby, uh
Put your ass right down here on this throne, yeah 
Don't you say n'ere a little word
Until you learn how to leave, leave that devil alone 
Let me run it down, I keep your paper coming in real steady 
I could tell you what the I in the pimp stands for
If your ready, ready, ready 
Your eyes are wide shut you cannot even see
That behind your back, he calls you names 
But you're still a queen to me

In this trusting place you can erase
Every tear that ever rolled down your weary face 
All the time you waste in that paper chase
Is time better spent in these arms of mine 
Heaven sent angel so divine

Listen to me now baby
Let me tell ya what I gotta do (tell ya) 
I gotta stop lettin' the devil
(define what it takes to be a woman) 
Stop lettin' him tell me what it takes to be a woman 
Gotta never stop believing in me, myself, and I
Pretty little lies that the rich keep using 
I opened up my eyes,
The only reason they're winning is 'cause I keep losing 
Gotta get back to my right place
This is the subject of my show 
We love the human race
This is where I belong 
Chorus 
Wonderfully, truly, caring you make the words I wish in every song. 
Come here now pretty baby let me take you somewhere and put you real close 
We've both been in the dark much too long 
Now that we got the knowledge and the truth we can both be strong 
Kings and Queens gettin' it on! 
Trusted place you can erase
Every tear that ever rolled down your weary face 
All the time you waste (wasted time)
In that paper chase 
(Can't you see that it's all time better spent right here) 
Is time better spent in these arms of mine,

When, when U give me that kiss, fill me through and through, huh

If I already ain't change your mind, tell U one more story 
Only a man that's truly blind can't see the glory 
Think about what U're doin' here, think about what U say 
If U shine the light on your brother when he's lost his way 
Then guess what?

Violet Blue
What's a woman 2 do? 
Across the street waits a man she's promised 2 
And in her presence is another with eyes of violet blue 
All aflame her body when he approaches - steam heat 
She closes her eyes, imagines his voice - so sweet, so sweet 
11 minutes and she'll be late 
What's a woman 2 do? 
Across the street waits the man she's promised 2 
Indecision reigns and the catalyst: eyes of violet blue 
11 minutes 2 love is 2 little, 2 much 
I could listen 4ever but if I hear 2 much 
It could stay in my mind and all could be lost 
If I'm not careful, I'd never want U so 
We already lost one minute 
4 us that's one more year we got in it 
4 us that's one more year things we don't know 
11 minutes 2 love 
Is he married? One day does he wanna be? 
I wish I could tell just from holdin' hands 
But with his eyes so gentle, he whispers 
Only mental communication is all he wants me 2 hear 
Even though I don't want 2 
I must leave him now 
I can't let him see my tears 
Though I turn away and notice the time - it's late 
But what's a woman 2 do? 
What's a woman 2 do?

A picture of a woman with a drink in her hand
Standing by a child with no eyes

Babies blown to kingdom come

Look better when they're on the run

He said he didn't wanna go to jail alone
The seed lives in the same mind
With the thought that says we all should be stoned
And people lookin' for aliens in the sky
Whenever they're broken-hearted
Love is grown. Seeds are sewn.

Yellow
Every girl of culture's got a favorite car 
The kind of car that makes a girl lose her cool 
My daddy had a yellow Riviera Star 
That he used 2 let me drive 2 school 
All the boys would follow me after class 
Never let 'em take me 4 a ride 
I didn't want 'em thinkin' that I was fast 
I mean nearly every girl has got her pride 
Every cheerleader in the senior class 
Really, really hated my yellow pants 
Maybe it was the way they hugged my ass 
But I was the one the fellas asked 2 dance 
Zina is the sister that I have 2 raise 
She's younger but her chest is bigger than mine 
But my voice is deeper so I got it made 
Real live men hate girls that whine 
Every man wants a dame with style 
A saint by day and a sinner at night 
I maybe talk dirty 4 a little while 
If he buys my dinner, that's alright 
Most boys think they're so c-cool 
As far as she can see, most boys are jerks 
Double time talkers with half-time jewels 
U know that ain't the way Sheila E. works 
I met a little pretty with yellow hair 
Wanted my body and my car 2 
I gave him everything cuz I didn't care 
Now this little yellow girl is blue 
Yellow's a happenin' color 
If U're a banana 
Countin' the days until U're a prune 
But blue's a better color 
If U're lookin' 4 a lover 
2 show your pretty colors 2",prince,yellow,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
